## Building an Object Oriented Pokemon Class Hierarchy

For this assignment, I've done part of the coding myself to give you something to start from. This will be a good experience for you to try to read someone else's code and understand what it is doing.

Your task is to complete an Object Oriented Pokemon Class hierarchy for the Squirtle, Wartortle, Blastoise and the Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard Pokemon species families. This is described by the UML diagram below. The UML image file is also in the 
repository as PokemonUMLDiagram.png

I have implemented everything in blue in the UML diagram. *Instructions continue below image*

----
What is included in this repository:
 * Pokemon.java - abstract superclass for all Pokemon species
  * This is basically an extension of your first assignment Pokemon with some new data fields and some abstract methods required of the subclasses.
  
 * Bulbasaur.java - Highest level subclass in the Grass|Poison dual-type Bulbasaur family
 * Ivysaur.java - Middle level subclass in the Bulbasaur family
 * Venusaur.java - Bottom level subclass in the Bulbasaur family
 
 * Interfaces (representing Pokemon types): These only implement constants. Two are Strings that hold descriptors, color and type, four are arrays that hold Strings of allowed fast and special attack names and their respective power values.
   * FireType.java
   * FlyingType.java
   * GrassType.java
   * PoisonType.java
   * WaterType.java
 * JUnit test files for all implemented species and those you are going to build:
  * BlastoiseTest, BulbasaurTest, CharizardTest, CharmanderTest, CharmeleonTest, IvysaurTest, SquirtleTest, VenusaurTest, and WartortleTest.java
  
 * TypeAttackEffectivenessChart.jpg - This shows the strength/weakness multipliers for different types. It should be used in your implementation of PerformFastAttack and PerformSpecialAttack methods.
 
 * PokemonAttackPower.xlsx and .ods - Spreadsheet of fast and special attack names, types, powers. These are already in the required interfaces, but you'll need them to do the extra credit projects.
 
 * PokemonHierarchy.gpj - This is the jGrasp project file. I have made a jGRASP project of this folder so it will generate the documentation and UML diagrams for you. When you open jGRASP go to the top menu item Project -> open and point it to the .gpj file. You will then see the Open Projects window and be able to see UML.
 
 * PokemonHierarchy_doc folder. This contains the documentation generated by my Javadoc comments in the .java files. If you double-click index.html that documentation should open in your webbrowser.

## Assignments

#### Part 1 due September 27th:
 1. Clone the repository to your own computer. 
 2. Thoroughly examine the code I have given you and the UML diagram above. Try to figure out what I have done and how you can build the rest.
 2. Test my code using jGRASP Interactions. For example, stuff like this should work already:
 ```
 Bulbasaur b1 = new Bulbasaur();
 
Venusaur v1 = new Venusaur("myVenus");

String s = b1.toString();

s = v1.performFastAttack(b1);
 ```
 3. Make a develop branch and push it to Github
  * git branch develop
  * git checkout develop
  * Make at least one change so there is a difference between the develop and master branches.
  * git push origin develop
 4. Make a Pull Request on GitHub.
  * In the pull request write an outline of what your plan for coding the rest of the Pokemon subclasses in the UML diagram.
  * This doesn't have to be perfect, you'll probably have to make changes to your plans while coding, I just want to see that you understand the provided code and are able to plan your additions to it.

#### Code Review Oct. 2nd
 * Have your Part 2 (described below) most of the way finished for code reviewing.

#### Part 2 due Oct.  9th:
 1. Write the rest of the Pokemon subclasses in the UML diagram
  3. Build Squirtle.java, Wartortle.java, and Blastoise.java first. They will be easiest because they're all the same type: water.
  4. Build Charmander.java and Charmaleon.java these are both the same type too: fire.
  5. Build Charizard which must implement an additional type interface: flying
  
 * The height, weight, and base attack, defense, and stamina stats for each species are here: [https://thesilphroad.com/catalog](https://thesilphroad.com/catalog)

## Extra Credit
 * Due by the final due date of this Assignment: October 9th.

 * 50 points.
 * Implement the interfaces and Pokemon subclasses for Eevee, Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon. Pokemon numbers 133 - 136.
   * This is tricky because Eevee is the superclass for the other three, but Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon are all different types and do not inherit Eevee's type. You may have to get creative/hackish with Eevee's Normal type to make this work. Just don't break the rest of the Pokemon!
   * Your Eevee family should also work with the ArrayList of Pokemon!
